# ------ tasks for competition ------ #
# build a website ( install httpd, (create http files?) copy files to correct folder, verify )
# create a user, change the password, install a service for that user (httpd?)
# create a container ( install dependencies, copy(create then copy?) dockerfile, make a build folder, build container, run container )
# 


# ------ course flow options ------ #
# ansible overview 2.x
# people build single modules
# what if we can connect these modules to do something?  
# contest to take modules and merge them into a play
# whoever comes up with the coolest play wins // or // pair up and build plays and whoever is faster wins
# focus is to build out the modules and show them at the end what they created (running website within a container that does something silly)

# ------ things we need ------ #
# servers or nucs to run ansible and at least one server to screw with
# rhpds for ansible? (so we dont need to build it?)
# repo for everyone to copy down from git ( for files like dockerfiles, html files, etc.
# -- is the folder just full of junk so they have to pick out the parts they need?
# music (i have the speaker)
